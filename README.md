# Connect Four

This is a project aiming to use the c++ modules and get familiar with them. Please do not take this project seriously as it is not.

If you want to run it, it is tested with clang 18 and cmake 3.27.8 and the ninja generator. Vcpkg is required to install the libraries although it can be disabled easily.
